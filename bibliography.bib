@article{Aldous.1998,
 abstract = {The multiplicative coalescent $X(t)$ is a $l^2$-valued Markov process 
representing coalescence of clusters of mass, where each pair of
clusters merges at rate proportional to product of masses. From random
graph asymptotics it is known (Aldous (1997)) that there exists a
standard version of this process starting with infinitesimally small
clusters at time $- \infty$. In this paper, stochastic calculus
techniques are used to describe all versions $(X(t);- \infty &lt; t
&lt; \infty)$ of the multiplicative coalescent. Roughly, an extreme
version is specified by translation and scale parameters, and a vector
$c \in l^3$ of relative sizes of large clusters at time $- \infty$.
Such a version may be characterized in three ways: via its $t \to -
\infty$ behavior, via a representation of the marginal distribution
$X(t)$ in terms of excursion-lengths of a Levy-type process, or via a
weak limit of processes derived from the standard version via a
{\dq}coloring{\dq} construction.},
