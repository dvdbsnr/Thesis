abstract = {Let {\$}(B{\^{}}t(s), 0 \backslashleq s {\textless} \backslashinfty){\$} be reflecting inhomogeneous Brownian motion with drift t - s at time s, started with Bt(0) = 0. Consider the random graph G(n, n-1 + tn-4/3), whose largest components have size of order n2/3. Normalizing by n-2/3, the asymptotic joint distribution of component sizes is the same as the joint distribution of excursion lengths of Bt (Corollary 2). The dynamics of merging of components as t increases are abstracted to define the multiplicative coalescent process. The states of this process are vectors x of nonnegative real cluster sizes (xi), and clusters with sizes xi and xj merge at rate xix j. The multiplicative coalescent is shown to be a Feller process on l2. The random graph limit specifies the standard multiplicative coalescent, which starts from infinitesimally small clusters at time -∞; the existence of such a process is not obvious.},

@book{Billingsley2009,
abstract = {{\{}A new look at weak-convergence methods in metric spaces-from a master of probability theory In this new edition, Patrick Billingsley updates his classic work Convergence of Probability Measures to reflect developments of the past thirty years. Widely known for his straightforward approach and reader-friendly style, Dr. Billingsley presents a clear, precise, up-to-date account of probability limit theory in metric spaces. He incorporates many examples and applications that illustrate the power and utility of this theory in a range of disciplines-from analysis and number theory to statistics, engineering, economics, and population biology. With an emphasis on the simplicity of the mathematics and smooth transitions between topics, the Second Edition boasts major revisions of the sections on dependent random variables as well as new sections on relative measure, on lacunary trigonometric series, and on the Poisson-Dirichlet distribution as a description of the long cycles in permutations and the large divisors of integers. Assuming only standard measure-theoretic probability and metric-space topology, Convergence of Probability Measures provides statisticians and mathematicians with basic tools of probability theory as well as a springboard to the "industrial-strength" literature available today.{\}}},

@techreport{Turner2010,
abstract = {The aim of this minicourse is to provide a number of tools that allow one to de- termine at which speed (if at all) the law of a diffusion process, or indeed a rather general Markov process, approaches its stationary distribution. Of particular in- terest will be cases where this speed is subexponential. After an introduction to the general ergodic theory of Markov processes, the first part of the course is devoted to Lyapunov function techniques. The second part is then devoted to an elementary introduction to Malliavin calculus and to a proof of Ho ̈rmander's famous ”sums of squares” regularity theorem.},
