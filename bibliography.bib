Consider the random graph G(n, n-1 + tn-4/3), whose largest components have size of order n2/3. Normalizing by n-2/3, the asymptotic joint distribution of component sizes is the same as the joint distribution of excursion lengths of Bt (Corollary 2). The dynamics of merging of components as t increases are abstracted to define the multiplicative coalescent process. The states of this process are vectors x of nonnegative real cluster sizes (xi), and clusters with sizes xi and xj merge at rate xix j. The multiplicative coalescent is shown to be a Feller process on l2. The random graph limit specifies the standard multiplicative coalescent, which starts from infinitesimally small clusters at time -∞; the existence of such a process is not obvious.},

abstractNote={This eagerly awaited textbook covers everything the graduate student in probability wants to know about Brownian motion, as well as the latest research in the area. Starting with the construction of Brownian motion, the book then proceeds to sample path properties like continuity and nowhere differentiability. Notions of fractal dimension are introduced early and are used throughout the book to describe fine properties of Brownian paths. The relation of Brownian motion and random walk is explored from several viewpoints, including a development of the theory of Brownian local times from random walk embeddings. Stochastic integration is introduced as a tool and an accessible treatment of the potential theory of Brownian motion clears the path for an extensive treatment of intersections of Brownian paths. An investigation of exceptional points on the Brownian path and an appendix on SLE processes, by Oded Schramm and Wendelin Werner, lead directly to recent research themes.}, publisher={Cambridge University Press}, author={Mörters, Peter and Peres, Yuval},

@techreport{Bjork2011,
abstract = {Since 1993 I have been a heavy user of Matlab; this manual is the result of my effort to learn Scilab. Consequently, it is written from the point of view of someone who is familiar with Matlab and wants to use this knowledge to ease his entry into Scilab. Hence, this manual explains Scilab's functionality by drawing on the experience and expectations of a Matlab user. Thus, features that are the same in both systems are “glossed over” to some degree and more space is devoted to those features where the two differ; examples are operator overloading and lists of all types. Overall, this manual is not tailored to the needs of someone who is not already somewhat familiar with either Matlab or Scilab. Nevertheless, quite a number of chapters, which do not refer to Matlab analogs, would be useful for Scilab users without Matlab background. To aid in the conversion of Matlab macros Table A.1 lists Matlab functions and their functional equivalents. Furthermore, the index includes an even more extensive lists of those Matlab functions and Scilab functions that are mentioned in the Manual. So one can look up quite a number of Matlab functions to find out what means there are in Scilab to achieve the same end. A user trying to figure out how to implement, say, a Matlab structure will be directed to Scilab lists. Someone who wants to understand the difference in the definition of workspace—which has the potential to trip up the unsuspecting—will need to look in the index which points to those pages that describe this difference. Incidentally, one branch of the Scilab directory tree is a directory with Scilab functions that “emu- late” Matlab functions. As explained more fully in Section 1.4 I do not advocate their use. Using such emulations deprives the user of the flexibility and power Scilab offers. In most cases it is a concept one needs to emulate not a function. This manual is organized in a number of chapters, sections, and subsections. Obviously, this is arbitrary and reflects my own choices. Several sections have tables of functions or operators pertinent to the subject matter discussed. Due to some overlap one and the same function may show up in several different tables. It was tempting to use unadulterated screen dumps as examples. However, Scilab wastes screen real estate the same way format loose does in Matlab — except, in Scilab, there is no equivalent to format compact, which suppresses the extra line-feeds. Hence, to conserve space, most examples are reproduced without some of these extra empty lines.},

@misc{Kingman1993,
abstract = {Two fundamental theories are commonly debated in the study of random processes: the Bachelier Wiener model of Brownian motion, which has been the subject of many books, and the Poisson process. While nearly every book mentions the Poisson process, most hurry past to more general point processes or to Markov chains. This comparative neglect is ill judged, and stems from a lack of perception of the real importance of the Poisson process. This distortion partly comes about from a restriction to one dimension, while the theory becomes more natural in more general contexts. This book attempts to redress the balance. It records the author's fascination with the beauty and wide applicability of Poisson processes in one or more dimensions. The mathematical theory is powerful and a few key results often produce surprising consequences.},

abstract = {{\{}A new look at weak-convergence methods in metric spaces-from a master of probability theory In this new edition, Patrick Billingsley updates his classic work Convergence of Probability Measures to reflect developments of the past thirty years. Widely known for his straightforward approach and reader-friendly style, Dr. Billingsley presents a clear, precise, up-to-date account of probability limit theory in metric spaces. He incorporates many examples and applications that illustrate the power and utility of this theory in a range of disciplines-from analysis and number theory to statistics, engineering, economics, and population biology. With an emphasis on the simplicity of the mathematics and smooth transitions between topics, the Second Edition boasts major revisions of the sections on dependent random variables as well as new sections on relative measure, on lacunary trigonometric series, and on the Poisson-Dirichlet distribution as a description of the long cycles in permutations and the large divisors of integers. Assuming only standard measure-theoretic probability and metric-space topology, Convergence of Probability Measures provides statisticians and mathematicians with basic tools of probability theory as well as a springboard to the "industrial-strength" literature available today.{\}}},

Chapter 13 is devoted to Palm theory and includes a new section on fractal dimensions.

abstract = {Extremes Values, Regular Variation and Point Processes is a readable and efficient account of the fundamental mathematical and stochastic process techniques needed to study the behavior of extreme values of phenomena based on independent and identically distributed random variables and vectors. It presents a coherent treatment of the distributional and sample path fundamental properties of extremes and records. It emphasizes the core primacy of three topics necessary for understanding extremes: the analytical theory of regularly varying functions; the probabilistic theory of point processes and random measures; and the link to asymptotic distribution approximations provided by the theory of weak convergence of probability measures in metric spaces. The book is self-contained and requires an introductory measure-theoretic course in probability as a prerequisite. Almost all sections have an extensive list of exercises which extend developments in the text, offer alternate approaches, test mastery and provide for enjoyable muscle flexing by a reader. The material is aimed at students and researchers in probability, statistics, financial engineering, mathematics, operations research, civil engineering and economics who need to know about: * asymptotic methods for extremes; * models for records and record frequencies; * stochastic process and point process methods and their applications to obtaining distributional approximations; * pervasive applications of the theory of regular variation in probability theory, statistics and financial engineering.

abstract = {The impact of invasions on local biodiversity is well established, but their impact on regional biodiversity has so far been only sketchily documented. To address this question, we studied the impact at various observation scales (ranging from the microhabitat to the whole catchment) of successive arrivals of non-native amphipods on the amphipod assemblage of the Loire River basin in France. Amphipod assemblages were studied at 225 sites covering the whole Loire catchment. Non-native species were dominant at all sites in the main channel of the Loire River, but native species were still present at most of the sites. We found that the invaders have failed to colonize most of tributaries of the Loire River. At the regional scale, we found that since the invaders first arrived 25 years ago, the global amphipod diversity has increased by 33{\%} (from 8 to 12 species) due to the arrival of non-native species. We discuss the possibility that the lack of any loss of biodiversity may be directly linked to the presence of refuges at the microhabitat scale in the Loire channel and in the tributaries, which invasive species have been unable to colonize. The restoration of river quality could increase the number of refuges for native species, thus reducing the impact of invaders.},
