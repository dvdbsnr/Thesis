abstract = {Let {\$}(B{\^{}}t(s), 0 \backslashleq s {\textless} \backslashinfty){\$} be reflecting inhomogeneous Brownian motion with drift t - s at time s, started with Bt(0) = 0. Consider the random graph G(n, n-1 + tn-4/3), whose largest components have size of order n2/3. Normalizing by n-2/3, the asymptotic joint distribution of component sizes is the same as the joint distribution of excursion lengths of Bt (Corollary 2). The dynamics of merging of components as t increases are abstracted to define the multiplicative coalescent process. The states of this process are vectors x of nonnegative real cluster sizes (xi), and clusters with sizes xi and xj merge at rate xix j. The multiplicative coalescent is shown to be a Feller process on l2. The random graph limit specifies the standard multiplicative coalescent, which starts from infinitesimally small clusters at time -∞; the existence of such a process is not obvious.},

@book{Bollobas2008,
abstract = {This handbook describes advances in large scale network studies that have taken place in the past 5 years since the publication of the Handbook of Graphs and Networks in 2003. It covers all aspects of large-scale networks, including mathematical foundations and rigorous results of random graph theory, modeling and computational aspects of large-scale networks, as well as areas in physics, biology, neuroscience, sociology and technical areas. Applications range from microscopic to mesoscopic and macroscopic models.The book is based on the material of the NSF workshop on Large-scale Random Graphs held in Budapest in 2006, at the Alfrd Rnyi Institute of Mathematics, organized jointly with the University of Memphis.},
