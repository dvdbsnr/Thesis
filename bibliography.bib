 abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to give a short introduction to the theory of point processes and random measures. Our hope is that the paper can be used as a complement to a study of Billingsley's book {\dq}Convergence of Probability Measures.{\dq} The subjects treated are: topological properties of the space of realizations; characterization and convergence of random measures with special attention to simple point processes and diffuse random measures; the relation between the topology used and the Skorohod topology. Some thinning and superposition results are given without proofs.},
