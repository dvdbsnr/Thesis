\fxnote{Definition weak convergence}
This section will probably move to a preliminary chapter.
\begin{definition}[Weak convergence]
	Let $S$ be a metric space and $\mathcal{S}$ it's class of Borel sets.
	Let $P, P_1, P_2, \dots$ be probability measures on defined on $S$.
	We say $P_n$ converges weakly to $P$, $P_n \Rightarrow P$, if
	\begin{equation} 
	\int_S fdP_n \xrightarrow{n \rightarrow \infty} \int_S fdP
	\end{equation}
	holds for all continuous, bounded functions $f: S \rightarrow \Real$.
\end{definition}

This definition now applies to convergence in distribution of random variables as follows:
Let $X, X_1, X_2, \dots$ be random variables on some probability space $S$.
Let $P, P_1, P_2, \dots$ be the corresponding distributions.

\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Prohorov's theorem] \label{T: Prohorov}
	Let $P_n$ be a series of probability measures on some metric space $S$. If $P_n$ is tight, then it is relatively compact.
\end{theorem}



We will prove weak convergence by showing that
\begin{equation}
\Exp{ f(\bar{Z}^t_n, \bar{N}_n) } \longrightarrow \Exp{ f(W^t, N) }
\end{equation}
as $n \rightarrow \infty$, 
for all continuous, bounded functions 
$f: D^2 \rightarrow \Real$.
