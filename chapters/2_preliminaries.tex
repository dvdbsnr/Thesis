\fxnote{Definition weak convergence}
This section will probably move to a preliminary chapter.
\begin{definition}[Weak convergence]
	Let $S$ be a metric space and $\mathcal{S}$ it's class of Borel sets.
	Let $P, P_1, P_2, \dots$ be probability measures on defined on $S$.
	We say $P_n$ converges weakly to $P$, $P_n \Rightarrow P$, if
	\begin{equation} 
	\int_S fdP_n \xrightarrow{n \rightarrow \infty} \int_S fdP
	\end{equation}
	holds for all continuous, bounded functions $f: S \rightarrow \Real$.
\end{definition}

This definition now applies to convergence in distribution of random variables as follows:
Let $X, X_1, X_2, \dots$ be random variables on some probability space $S$.
Let $P, P_1, P_2, \dots$ be the corresponding distributions.

\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Prohorov's theorem] \label{T: Prohorov}
	Let $P_n$ be a series of probability measures on some metric space $S$. If $P_n$ is tight, then it is relatively compact.
\end{theorem}



We will prove weak convergence by showing that
\begin{equation}
\Exp{ f(\bar{Z}^t_n, \bar{N}_n) } \longrightarrow \Exp{ f(W^t, N) }
\end{equation}
as $n \rightarrow \infty$, 
for all continuous, bounded functions 
$f: D^2 \rightarrow \Real$.

We state the theorem here, without proof, as it appears in \cite[p. 339 f.]{Ethier.2005},
omitting one of two equivalent conditions and all references to higher dimensional processes,
in order to focus on the one-dimensional case we will need for our proof.

% Central limit theorem for martingales: Statement
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{theorem}[Central limit theorem for martingales] \label{T: functional CLT martingales}
	Let $\{\Fn{t}\}$ be a filtration and $M_n$ a $\{\Fn{t}\}$-local martingale with sample paths in $D_{\Real}[0,\infty)$ and $\Mn{0}=0$.
	Let $B_n$ be a process with sample paths in $D_{\Real}[0,\infty)$, increasing in $t$, such that $M_n^2 - B_n$ is an $\{\Fn{t}\}$-local martingale.
	
	Let the following conditions hold:
	For each $T>0$,
	\begin{equation} \label{E: cond1 CLT}
	\lim_{n->\infty} \ExpBig{
		\sup_{t \leq T} | \Bn{t} - \Bn{t-}|
	} = 0,
	\end{equation}
	\begin{equation} \label{E: cond2 CLT}
	\lim_{n->\infty} \ExpBig{
		\sup_{t \leq T} | \Mn{t} - \Mn{t-}|^2
	} = 0,
	\end{equation}
	and with $c(t)$ a continuous, increasing function on $[0, \infty)$, $c(0) = 0$, let
	\begin{equation} \label{E: cond3 CLT}
	\Bn{t} \longrightarrow_p c(t).
	\end{equation}
	Then $M_n \longrightarrow_d X$ where $X$ is a process with sample paths in $C_{\Real}[0,\infty)$ and independent Gaussian increments.
\end{theorem}
