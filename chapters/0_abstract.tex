%	The Erdös-Renyi random graph $\Gcal(n, \p)$ on $n$ vertices with edge probability $\p = n^{-1} + \pp \n{-4}{3}$
%	for some $\pp \in \Real$ is called critical and its component sizes are of order $\n{2}{3}$.
	
	Component sizes in the critical Erdös-Renyi random graph $\Gcal(n, \p)$
	(i.e. with edge probability $\p = n^{-1} + \pp \n{-4}{3}$ for some $\pp \in \Real$)
	are of order $\n{2}{3}$.
	As $n \rightarrow\infty$, the ordered component sizes and corresponding counts of surplus edges
	(both rescaled by $\n{-2}{3}$) converge in distribution to a limit.
	
	Attach a downward drift $\pp - t$ to a Brownian motion $W(t)$ by $\Wt(t) = W(t) + \int_0^t(\pp-s)ds$
	and reflect this process at the $x$-axis by $\Bt(t) = \Wt(t) - \min_{s \leq t} \Wt(s)$.
	The limit of component sizes and surplus edges is distributed as the ordered lengths of excursions of $\Bt$ above zero 
	and marks of a Poisson point process with rate $\Bt$.
