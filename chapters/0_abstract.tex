%	The Erdös-Renyi random graph $\Gcal(n, \p)$ on $n$ vertices with edge probability $\p = n^{-1} + \pp \n{-4}{3}$
%	for some $\pp \in \Real$ is called critical and its component sizes are of order $\n{2}{3}$.
	\noindent
	Based on a 1997 paper by David Aldous we analyse component sizes in the critical Erd\H os-Rényi random graph,
	$\Gcal(n, \p)$ with edge probability $\p = n^{-1} + \pp \n{-4}{3}$ for $n \in \Nat$ and some $\pp \in \Real$.
	
	In general, component sizes will be of order $\n{2}{3}$.
	As $n \rightarrow\infty$, the ordered component sizes and corresponding counts of surplus edges
	(both rescaled by $\n{-2}{3}$) converge in distribution to a limit.
	
	Let $W(t)$ be a standard Brownian motion. Attach a downward drift of $\pp - t$ by $\Wt(t) = W(t) + \int_0^t(\pp-s)ds$
	and reflect this process at the $x$-axis by $\Bt(t) = \Wt(t) - \min_{s \leq t} \Wt(s)$.
	The limit of component sizes and surplus edges is distributed as the ordered lengths of excursions of $\Bt$ above zero 
	and marks of a Poisson point process with rate $\Bt$.
	
	While parts of the original paper rely on deep results on random graphs about bounds on the number of tree components, 
	unicyclic components and complex components, 
	we provide a self-contained proof that substantially simplifies the argument.
