% SECTION: General results on component sizes
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In this section we discuss previous results on component sizes in the Erdös-Renyi random graph.
We begin with the subcritical graph, that is
$\Gcal \in \mathscr{G}(n, \p)$ with $\p < \frac{1}{n}$.

Define $\lambda = \p n$ and $I_{\lambda}$ as the large deviation rate functions for Poisson random variables with mean $\lambda$,
that is
\begin{equation}
	I_{\lambda} = \lambda - 1 - \log(\lambda).
\end{equation}

The following theorem provides an upper bound on the size of $\Ccal_{\max}$, the largest component of $\Gcal$.
See \cite[Theorem 4.4, p.125]{vanderHofstad.2016}.
\begin{theorem}[Lower bound on largest subcritical component]
	Fix $\lambda < 1$. 
	Then, for all $a > 1/I_{\lambda}$, 
	there exists $\delta = \delta(a, \lambda)$ such that
	\begin{equation}
		\Prob( |\Ccal_{\max}| \geq a \log n ) = \BigO{n^{-\delta}}.
	\end{equation}
\end{theorem}

The next theorem gives an upper bound for the size of $\Ccal_{\max}$.
See \cite[Theorem 4.5, p.125]{vanderHofstad.2016}.
\begin{theorem}[Upper bound on largest subcritical component]
	Fix $\lambda < 1$. 
	Then, for all $a < 1/I_{\lambda}$, 
	there exists $\delta = \delta(a, \lambda)$ such that
	\begin{equation}
	\Prob( |\Ccal_{\max}| \leq a \log n ) = \BigO{n^{-\delta}}.
	\end{equation}
\end{theorem}

Together, these theorems imply
\begin{equation}
	\frac{|\Ccal_{\max}|}{\log n} \rightarrow_p 1/I_{\lambda}.
\end{equation}

We have established that, for $\p n < 1$, the expected largest component size will be of order $\log n$.

Consider the opposite case, $\lambda = \p n > 1$. 
Denote by $\xi_\lambda = 1 - \eta_n\lambda$ the survival probability of a Poisson branching process with mean offspring $\lambda$.
Note that $\xi_\lambda > 0$ since $\lambda > 1$.
Any vertex is part of a large component with probability $\xi_\lambda$, 
therefore we will expect around $n \xi_\lambda$ vertices being part of large connected components.
The following theorem now states that all of these vertices are, in fact, part of the same connected component, which we call the giant component.
\fxnote{Add explanation for Poisson branching process}
See \cite[Theorem 4.8, p.131]{vanderHofstad.2016}.
\begin{theorem}[Law of large numbers for giant component]
	Fix $\lambda>1$.
	Then, for all $\nu \in (\frac{1}{2}, 1)$, there exists $\delta = \delta(\nu, \lambda)$ such that
	\begin{equation}
		\Prob\left( \left| |\Ccal_{\max}| - n \xi_\lambda \right| \geq n^{\nu}\right) = \BigO{n^{-\delta}}.
	\end{equation}
\end{theorem}

\fxnote{What size is this giant component?}

To recap: For $n \p < 1$ we expect many small clusters of size at most $\log n$,
for $n \p > 1$ we expect one giant component, rapidly approaching size $n$.
But what happens around $n \p \approx 1$?
As it turns out, the emergence of the giant component occurs quite rapidly,
such that shortly after $n \p = 1$ most graphs do not have any component of order between $\frac{1}{2}\n{2}{3}$ and $\n{2}{3}$.
We switch to the language of $\mathscr{G}(n,m)$ for the following theorem.
\begin{theorem}
test
\end{theorem}

For an estimate on when exactly this giant component emerges, we quote \cite[Theorem 6.8, p.142]{Bollobas.2001} for
\begin{theorem}
	Almost every graph process $\Gcal = (\Gcal_t)_0^n$ is such that 
	for every $t \geq t_1 = \floor{ n/2 + 2(\log n)^{1/2}\n{2}{3} }$ 
	the graph $\Gcal_t$ has a unique component of order at least $\n{2}{3}$ and the other components have at most $\frac{1}{2}\n{2}{3}$
\end{theorem}





As it turns out, there is a so-called critical window in which the component sizes are not of size $\log n$ and there is no giant component yet.
We call a random graph $\Gcal \in \mathscr(n, n^{-1} + t\n{-4}{3})$ critical, for $t \in \Real$.

The following theorem proves that the rescaled sequence of sizes of the biggest component in $\Gcal$ is tight.
That is, with high probability it is contained in some compact subset of $\Real$.
See \cite[Theorem 5.1, p.150]{vanderHofstad.2016}
\begin{theorem}[Largest critical cluster]
	Let $\lambda = 1 + t\n{-1}{3}$, with $t \in \Real$.
	There exists a constant $b = b(t)$ such that for all $\omega > 1$,
	\begin{equation}
		\Prob\left( \omega^{-1} \n{2}{3} \leq |\Ccal_{\max}| \leq \omega \n{2}{3}\right) \geq 1 - \frac{b}{\omega}.
	\end{equation}	
\end{theorem}

If we rescaled the size of the biggest component by $\n{-2}{3}$,
it is with high probability contained in the compact interval $[\omega^{-1}, \omega]$.

We will now state the main theorem of this thesis, which we will prove gradually in the following chapters.
\begin{theorem}[Main theorem] \label{T: Main}
	Let 
	$\Cnt(1) \geq \Cnt(2) \geq ... $ 
	be the ordered component sizes of 
	$\Gcal \in \Gnt$
	and let
	$\sigmant(j)$ 
	be the surplus of the corresponding component.
	Then, as $n \longrightarrow \infty$,
	\begin{equation}
	( \n{-2}{3} ( \Cnt(j), \sigmant(j) ), \; j \geq 1 ) 
	\longrightarrow_p
	( (\Ct(j), \sigmat), \; j \geq 1 )
	= ( \Ctbold, \sigmatbold ),
	\end{equation}
	where the convergence 
	$\n{-2}{3} \Cntbold \rightarrow_p \Ctbold$
	holds with respect to the $\ld$ topology.
	
	The limit
	$\left( ( \Ct(j), \sigmat(j) ), \; j \geq 1 \right)$
	is distributed as the sequence
	$ \left( (|\gamma_j|, \mu(\gamma_j)), j \geq 1  \right) $
	of lengths and mark-counts of excursions of $\mathcal{B}^t$.
\end{theorem}
